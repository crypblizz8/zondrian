## Zondrian
Mondrian Art + Zora 

Inspired by Piet Mondrian + Generative Art + Zora API Hackathon projects, I thought I would create a fusion of these ideas.

Using Zora API events, use that randomness to create Mondrian-like p5.js art.

Functions:
- Take in Zora API for the randomized position of the rectangles.
- Mint your own
- Zora Marketplace for 10 Zondrians marking a special event of the Ethereum Blockchain (Birth of Bitcoin, Birth of Ethereum, DAO Hack, Others)
